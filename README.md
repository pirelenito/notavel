# Notavel

A Note taking application built for hackers. Not exactly an application yet... still just thrown code.

Key objectives:

- Should save as plain Markdown files;
- Easy browsing of notes (history, labels);
- Editing should be done externally (Sublime is much better at it);
- Support for multiple "stores";
- Search.

## History

This is a new take on the implementation. For the original code, check the [v1 branch](tree/v1).

## Open-source alternatives

- [Boostnote](https://b00st.io/): good UI, but forces you to use its own JSON format for the notes;
- [PileMd](https://github.com/hirokiky/pilemd/): also forces a JSON format;
- [Moeditor](https://github.com/Moeditor/Moeditor): just a Markdown editor.
